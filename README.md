To be honest, I'm awfully hostile to "excert my power over LeetCode" or any similar service. Yet I should admit that these exercises do make sense for gaining knowledge about algorithms, data structures, etc. to some extent. Anyway, this repository is created for my solutions, either first-thought or second-thought, to LeetCode problems, and will be updated ~~when I'm in a good mode~~ frequently.
